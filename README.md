SimpleBoy is a GameBoy emulator which aims to be cleanly and simply coded while providing
a very good emulation accuracy. Its currently very much a work in progress. Cross platform
compatibility, debugging capabilities and a GUI are all planned.

Please note this emulator was originally named "Just Another GameBoy Emulator" or "JAGBE"
for short. This was before it was realised another project was already using this name. Any
references to this name at this point are leftovers and have nothing to do with this other
project.

Game Boy is a registered trademark of Nintendo Co., Ltd. The SimpleBoy project is in no way
affiliated with Nintendo. The purpose of this project is purely educational.
